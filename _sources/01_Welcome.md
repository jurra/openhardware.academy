## What is the Open Hardware Academy?

The Open Hardware Academy is originally conceived as a 10-week program that helps you to develop your own open hardware project. In the 10 weeks participants have learned about project management, documentation, community building, prototyping and licenses for open hardware among other topics. **By the way, did we tell you itâ€™s free?**

Take a look at our [main lessons](./03_Lessons.md) with exercises.

We have designed the lessons in such a way that you can do them in your own time. 

We have also developed complementary technical lessons to develop your skills in the field of open hardware.

## Work on a challenge

**To onboard you in our academy it is good enough for us to know that you would like to work on a challenge.**

We suggest you to have a short list of 5 to 3 challenges that you feel can be a good fit for you. Once you are onboarded in the program and you have a better understanding of the challenges you can choose one to work on. We expect this to happen in the first two weeks of the program. There might be an opportunity to for example join a team, or that several people work on the same challenge.
